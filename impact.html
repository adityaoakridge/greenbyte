        <h1>Impact</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Environmental Impact: Excessive energy consumption contributes to a higher carbon footprint, exacerbating climate change 
                and environmental degradation, especially if the energy comes from non-renewable sources.</li>
            <li>Operational Costs: Businesses face increased operational costs for energy that is being wasted, impacting the companyâ€™s bottom line.</li>
            <li>Resource Strain: The demand for energy from technology infrastructure can strain local power grids and energy resources, 
                potentially leading to power shortages or infrastructure challenges.</li>
            <li>Social and Economic: Disparities in access to technology exacerbate inequalities, while reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources 
                perpetuates dependence on volatile markets. We delve into the social and economic dimensions of the tech energy dilemma, 
                shedding light on its broader implications.</li>

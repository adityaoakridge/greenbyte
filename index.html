        <h3>Addressing the Excessive Consumption of Energy by Tech Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The exponential growth of technology has led to a surge in energy demand across various sectors. Data centers, 
        which store and process vast amounts of information, are one of the most energy-intensive components of tech infrastructure. 
        Additionally, the manufacturing and disposal of electronic devices contribute to environmental degradation and energy consumption.
        <br><br>
        We at Greenbyte explore the impact of excess energy consumption by tech sector and potential solutions towards a sustainable future.
